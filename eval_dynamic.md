# Dynamic Evaluation: Agent Runs and Scoring

## Scoring System

Agent responses are evaluated on a 0-2 scale:
- 0: No relevant commands generated or completely incorrect
- 1: Partially correct commands with some missing elements
- 2: Accurate and complete command sequence

## Test Run Results

### Run 1: Git Branch Creation
**Input:** "Create a new Git branch and switch to it"
**Agent Output:** `git checkout -b new-feature`
**Expected:** `git checkout -b new-branch`
**Score:** 2/2
**Notes:** Correct command structure and functionality

### Run 2: File Compression
**Input:** "Compress the folder reports into reports.tar.gz"
**Agent Output:** `tar -czf reports.tar.gz reports/`
**Expected:** `tar -czf reports.tar.gz reports/`
**Score:** 2/2
**Notes:** Perfect match with expected output

### Run 3: Python File Search
**Input:** "List all Python files in the current directory recursively"
**Agent Output:** `find . -name "*.py"`
**Expected:** `find . -name "*.py" -type f`
**Score:** 1/2
**Notes:** Missing -type f flag but functionally correct

### Run 4: Virtual Environment Setup
**Input:** "Set up a virtual environment and install requests"
**Agent Output:** 
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install requests
```
**Expected:** Same sequence
**Score:** 2/2
**Notes:** Complete and correct multi-step process

### Run 5: Log File Reading
**Input:** "Fetch only the first ten lines of a file named output.log"
**Agent Output:** `head -10 output.log`
**Expected:** `head -n 10 output.log`
**Score:** 1/2
**Notes:** Functionally correct but missing -n flag

### Run 6: Development Environment Setup
**Input:** "Set up a complete Python development environment"
**Agent Output:**
```
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
**Expected:** Similar multi-step sequence
**Score:** 2/2
**Notes:** Complete workflow with all necessary steps

### Run 7: Process Monitoring
**Input:** "Find all processes consuming more than 80% CPU"
**Agent Output:** `Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 80}`
**Expected:** PowerShell command for Windows environment
**Score:** 2/2
**Notes:** Appropriate for Windows environment

### Run 8: File Permissions
**Input:** "Change permissions of script.sh to make it executable"
**Agent Output:** `chmod +x script.sh`
**Expected:** `chmod +x script.sh`
**Score:** 2/2
**Notes:** Standard Unix permission command

### Run 9: Directory Creation
**Input:** "Create a new directory called project and navigate to it"
**Agent Output:** 
```
mkdir project
cd project
```
**Expected:** Same sequence
**Score:** 2/2
**Notes:** Correct two-step process

### Run 10: Package Installation
**Input:** "Install numpy and pandas using pip"
**Agent Output:** `pip install numpy pandas`
**Expected:** `pip install numpy pandas`
**Score:** 2/2
**Notes:** Efficient single command approach

## Scoring Summary

| Run | Task | Score | Success Rate |
|-----|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Git Operations | 2/2 | 100% |
| 2 | File Compression | 2/2 | 100% |
| 3 | File Search | 1/2 | 50% |
| 4 | Environment Setup | 2/2 | 100% |
| 5 | File Reading | 1/2 | 50% |
| 6 | Dev Environment | 2/2 | 100% |
| 7 | Process Monitoring | 2/2 | 100% |
| 8 | File Permissions | 2/2 | 100% |
| 9 | Directory Operations | 2/2 | 100% |
| 10 | Package Management | 2/2 | 100% |

**Total Score:** 18/20 (90%)
**Average Score:** 1.8/2

## Performance Analysis

**Perfect Scores (2/2):** 8 out of 10 runs
- Git operations
- File compression
- Environment setup
- Development workflow
- Process monitoring
- File permissions
- Directory operations
- Package management

**Partial Scores (1/2):** 2 out of 10 runs
- File search (missing type flag)
- File reading (missing -n flag)

**Failed Scores (0/2):** 0 out of 10 runs

## Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- High success rate on common CLI operations
- Accurate multi-step command sequences
- Good understanding of different environments (Windows/Unix)
- Consistent performance across different task types

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Command flag completeness (missing optional but recommended flags)
- Edge case handling for less common operations
- Cross-platform command variations

**Overall Assessment:**
The agent demonstrates strong performance with a 90% success rate. Most failures are minor issues with command flags rather than fundamental misunderstandings of the required operations.
