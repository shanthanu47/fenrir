## Analysis

The fine-tuned model shows mixed results compared to the base model:

**Strengths:**
- Slightly better ROUGE scores overall
- Improved quality scores on complex multi-step tasks
- More structured responses with step-by-step breakdowns

**Weaknesses:**
- Lower BLEU scores indicating less exact command matching
- Some responses focus on explanation rather than executable commands
- Inconsistent performance across different task types

**Overall Assessment:**
The fine-tuning process shows marginal improvements but indicates the need for better training data and evaluation metrics focused on command accuracy rather than general text similarity.
